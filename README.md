# Dinner-is-served React-Redux Project
Dinner-is-served is an on line cookbook, full of a lazy persons recipes. That lazy person is definitely me! I don't like to cook and this dislike has become quite an issue with being a mom. Therefore, I created this wonderful recipe collection, of all the things I can make that are quick, easy and **take up to 10 steps to create**. Here's a live [link](https://Dinner-is-served-client.herokuapp.com/)! Let me know what you think, and as usual I hope you enjoy my site!
